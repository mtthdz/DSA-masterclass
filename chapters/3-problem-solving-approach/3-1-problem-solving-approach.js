/**
 * Chapter 3 - Algorithms and Problem Solving Approach
 * 
 * An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish
 * a certain task.
 * It's important to understand the problem. A few points
 * to keep in mind when solving a problem:
 *  1. can I restate the problem?
 *  2. what are the inputs?
 *  3. what are the outputs?
 *  4. can the outputs be determined from inputs?
 *  5. How should I label the important data?
 * 
 * When solving, it's a good idea to start with simple examples
 * before exploring more complex edgecases
 * It's also good to explore valid versus invalid inputs
 * 
 * When refactoring, there's a few questions that we can ask:
 *  1. can you derive the result differently?
 *  2. can you use the result or method for some other problem?
 *  3. can you improve the performance of your solution?
 *  4. how have other people solved this problem?
 *
